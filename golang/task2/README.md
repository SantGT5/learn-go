Create a function that returns the CSV representation of a two-dimensional numeric array.

Example:

```go
// input ->
   [[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ],
    [ 10,11,12,13,14 ],
    [ 20,21,22,23,24 ],
    [ 30,31,32,33,34 ]] 
```

```bash
# output: -> 
     '0,1,2,3,4\n'
    +'10,11,12,13,14\n'
    +'20,21,22,23,24\n'
    +'30,31,32,33,34'
```

Note: you shouldn't escape the \n, it should work as a new line.
